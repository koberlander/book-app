Welcome to Books! Books! Books!
-------

This app is a book collection tracker. You can add to, remove from, and edit items in your book hoard. 

It uses Node and Express to build a RESTful API.

Notes:
------
There are a few outstanding issues to be ironed out in future releases:
 1) The book delete method is not behaving properly and needs more work.

The frontend is built in React and uses Semantic UI React and custom CSS for styling. See that repository [here](https://github.com/koberlander/book-app-frontend).
