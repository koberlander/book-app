# README

Welcome to Books! Books! Books!
-------

This app is a book collection tracker. You can add to and edit items in your book hoard. 

It uses Node and Express to build a RESTful API.

Notes:
The book delete method does not work yet but will be addressed in the next release.

The frontend is built in React and uses Semantic UI React and custom CSS for styling. See that repository [here](https://github.com/koberlander/book-app-frontend).
